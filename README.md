This is a small system for managing a music collection as seen [here](https://gist.github.com/jgoulah/fc742e8512ff730a86d262c25bbf549b).

# Run the program from the CLI:
Give yourself permission to run the script: `chmod +x music`
Then run it from the CLI: `$ ./music`

# Run the tests from the CLI:
Make sure you have RSpec installed and run this command:
`ruby music_test.rb`
